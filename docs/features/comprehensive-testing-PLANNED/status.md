#### Phase 2: Unit & API Tests (Week 2)
- [ ] 2.0 Implement Frontend Unit Testing Framework (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] 3.0 Create Backend API Testing Suite (6/6 tasks)

#### Phase 3: Integration & E2E (Week 3)
- [ ] 4.0 Build Integration Testing for User Workflows (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] 5.0 Develop End-to-End Testing with Puppeteer (6/6 tasks)

#### Phase 4: Performance & Automation (Week 4)
- [ ] 6.0 Add Performance Testing and CI/CD Integration (6/6 tasks)

## Key Milestones

- [ ] **Phase 1 Complete:** Testing infrastructure and dependencies ready
- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete:** Unit and API tests implemented with coverage targets met
- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete:** Integration and E2E tests covering critical user journeys
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete:** Performance testing and CI/CD automation fully operational

## Success Metrics ðŸŽ¯

### Code Coverage Targets
- [ ] Frontend JavaScript: >85% line coverage
- [ ] Backend Python: >80% coverage
- [ ] StateManager: 100% method coverage
- [ ] Critical user flows: 100% integration coverage

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Unit test execution: <30 seconds
- [ ] Full test suite: <5 minutes
- [ ] Team loading performance: <2 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage regression: <5MB growth

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Zero test failures in CI/CD
- [ ] Flaky test rate: <5%
- [ ] Deployment blocking on test failures
- [ ] Coverage trend tracking operational

## Technology Stack

**Frontend Testing:**
- Jest with jsdom environment
- @testing-library utilities for DOM testing
- Coverage with nyc/istanbul

**Backend Testing:**
- pytest with Flask testing client
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Mock fixtures for TeamSnap API

**E2E Testing:**
- Puppeteer (existing setup, zero additional dependencies)
- Chrome-based browser automation
- Network interception for error testing

**CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions workflow integration
- Automated test execution on PRs
- Coverage reporting and trend tracking

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 with task 1.1: Add Jest dependencies to package.json
2. Set up Jest configuration and test directory structure
3. Install pytest dependencies and configure backend testing
4. Create initial test setup files and validate configuration

## Dependencies

**External:**
- Jest and DOM testing utilities (new)
- pytest and Flask testing tools (new)
- No additional E2E dependencies (Puppeteer already available)

**Internal:**
- StateManager extraction for testability
- Stable CSS selectors for E2E tests
- Flask application test client setup

## Notes

**Scope Focus:** Comprehensive testing infrastructure from zero to production-ready
**Implementation:** Phased approach allowing incremental adoption
**Browser Testing:** Chrome-only via Puppeteer (covers 70%+ users, can expand later)
**Priority:** Critical foundation work for production confidence
