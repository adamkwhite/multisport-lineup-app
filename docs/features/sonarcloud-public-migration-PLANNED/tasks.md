# SonarCloud Migration - Implementation Tasks

Generated from: `sonarcloud-migration-prd.md`

## Relevant Files

- `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml:109-123` - SonarQube scan and quality gate steps (replace with SonarCloud)
- `README.md:3-13` - SonarQube badge URLs (replace with SonarCloud badges)
- `docs/development/ci-cd-pipeline.md` - CI/CD documentation (update SonarQube references)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context (update SonarQube references if present)
- `docs/development/sonarcloud-migration.md` - New migration documentation (to be created)

### Notes

- This migration is infrastructure-focused with no application code changes required
- All changes maintain existing quality gate thresholds exactly
- SonarCloud account setup happens externally before code changes
- Testing requires creating a test branch and verifying CI/CD pipeline runs
