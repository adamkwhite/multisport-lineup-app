# Table Output Format (PLANNED)

## Overview
Alternative single-page table format for coaches who prefer a compact printout instead of multiple visual baseball diamond pages.

## Current Implementation
The app currently generates 3 separate visual baseball diamond layouts (one per 2-inning lineup), which prints across multiple pages.

## Proposed Feature
Single-page table format showing all positions across all innings in a grid layout:
- Rows: Players
- Columns: Innings (1-9)
- Cells: Position assignments

## Benefits
- **Single page** - All lineup information on one printout
- **Compact** - Easy to reference during game
- **Familiar** - Traditional format many coaches use
- **Mobile-friendly** - Easier to view on smaller screens

## Reference
See `BaseballLinupFormat.csv` for example format structure.

## Status
Feature not yet implemented. No PRD created.
