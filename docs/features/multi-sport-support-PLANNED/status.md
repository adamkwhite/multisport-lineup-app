## Implementation Summary

1. ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/multi-sport-frontend-ui`
2. ✅ Implemented all frontend tasks from `tasks.md`
3. ✅ Fixed critical security and code quality issues from review
4. ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage (358 total tests passing)
5. ⏳ Awaiting final CI/CD checks and PR approval

## Future Enhancements

- Template consolidation (reduce duplication)
- Volleyball court diagram visual (currently simple grid)

## Notes

- Backend is 100% complete and functional
- Frontend is currently hardcoded for baseball only
- **New Architecture:** Landing page with image-based sport selection
  - `/` → Landing page with 3 sport boxes (Volleyball, Baseball, Soccer)
  - `/baseball` → Baseball-specific dashboard (existing functionality)
  - `/volleyball` → Volleyball-specific dashboard (new)
  - `/soccer` → Coming soon placeholder (new)
- Focus on baseball + volleyball initially (soccer placeholder only)
- Maintain backwards compatibility - baseball should work exactly as before
- User will provide sport images for landing page
