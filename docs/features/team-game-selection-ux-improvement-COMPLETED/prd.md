# Team & Game Selection UX Improvement

## Overview

The current "Select Team & Game" page creates user confusion because the selection mechanism is not intuitive. Users see team information displayed but don't understand how to select a team or proceed to the next step. This PRD outlines improvements to make the selection process clearer and more user-friendly.

## Problem Statement

Users are getting confused on the "Select Team & Game" page and don't realize they need to make selections to proceed. The current interface shows team cards but lacks clear visual cues for:
- How to select a team (clicking is not obvious)
- Whether a selection has been made
- How to proceed to the next step
- Required vs optional selections

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- Make team selection mechanism immediately obvious to users
- Provide clear visual feedback when selections are made
- Reduce user confusion and support requests related to this page
- Maintain current workflow after selection

### Secondary Goals
- Improve overall user confidence in the application
- Reduce time spent on the selection page
- Create consistency with modern UI patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can immediately identify how to select a team
- [ ] Clear visual indication when a team is selected
- [ ] Obvious path forward after making selections
- [ ] Reduced user confusion reports by 80%
- [ ] Consistent with existing app design patterns

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Team Selection Mechanism**
   - Replace implicit click-to-select with explicit radio buttons or checkboxes
   - Add clear "Select" buttons on team cards
   - Maintain current filter dropdown functionality

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Highlight selected teams with distinct visual styling
   - Show selection state clearly (selected vs unselected)
   - Provide hover states to indicate clickable areas

3. **Instructions and Guidance**
   - Add clear instructional text: "Select a team to continue"
   - Include visual cues (icons, arrows) to guide user attention
   - Show progress indicator if part of multi-step flow

4. **Navigation**
   - Add prominent "Continue" or "Next" button that activates after selection
   - Disable/gray out continue button until selection is made
   - Maintain current post-selection workflow

### Technical Requirements

1. **State Management**
   - Track selected team state clearly
   - Validate selection before allowing progression
   - Preserve selection during page interactions

2. **Performance**
   - No impact on current page load times
   - Smooth transitions and animations (< 300ms)

3. **Compatibility**
   - Work consistently across existing supported browsers
   - Maintain responsive design

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Coaches, Team Managers, Parents)

**As a coach setting up a lineup,**
I want to clearly understand how to select my team,
So that I can quickly proceed to creating the lineup without confusion.

**As a team manager,**
I want visual confirmation that I've selected the correct team,
So that I'm confident I'm working with the right roster.

**As a parent using the app for the first time,**
I want clear guidance on what actions I need to take,
So that I don't get stuck or confused on the selection page.

## Technical Specifications

### Proposed UI Changes

1. **Team Card Enhancement**
   - Add radio button or prominent "Select Team" button to each team card
   - Apply selected state styling (border highlight, background color change)
   - Add hover effects to indicate interactivity

2. **Page Instructions**
   - Add header text: "Choose your team to get started"
   - Include icon or visual indicator pointing to selection area

3. **Navigation Button**
   - Add "Continue to Players" button at bottom of page
   - Enable only after team selection
   - Clear visual hierarchy (primary button styling)

### Implementation Approach

- Enhance existing team card components
- Add selection state management
- Implement button enable/disable logic
- Update styling for selected states

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Current team card component structure
- Existing navigation system
- Current state management patterns

### External Dependencies
- None identified

## Timeline

**Phase 1: Core Selection Mechanism (1-2 days)**
- Add radio buttons or select buttons to team cards
- Implement selection state management
- Add continue button with enable/disable logic

**Phase 2: Visual Polish (1 day)**
- Add selected state styling
- Implement hover effects
- Add instructional text and icons

**Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (1 day)**
- User testing with existing patterns
- Cross-browser validation

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk: Changes disrupt existing user muscle memory**
*Mitigation: Maintain existing team card layout and enhance rather than replace*

**Risk: Additional UI elements clutter the interface**
*Mitigation: Use subtle visual enhancements and follow existing design system*

**Risk: Implementation affects other team selection flows**
*Mitigation: Identify and test all team selection touchpoints*

## Out of Scope

- Changes to team filtering functionality
- Game selection improvements (focus on team selection only)
- Major restructuring of the page layout
- Changes to post-selection workflow
- Addition of new team management features
- Guided tour or onboarding tooltips (saved for future GitHub issue)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No confusion about next steps

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Selection state persists during page interactions

- [ ] No impact on existing team data display
- [ ] Consistent with app's design system

### Integration Validation
- [ ] Post-selection workflow remains unchanged
