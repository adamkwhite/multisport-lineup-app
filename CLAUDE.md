# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Type**: Web application for youth sports team management
**Purpose**: Generates optimized lineups for multiple sports (baseball, soccer, volleyball) with TeamSnap integration
**Status**: MVP complete for baseball, multi-sport support in active development
**Current Branch**: main

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **API Integration**: TeamSnap API (OAuth 2.0)
- **Deployment**: Designed for Heroku
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Self-signed certificates for local development
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov (94%+ coverage target)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (3-stage pipeline), SonarQube
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, bandit

## Key Features

### Implemented
- TeamSnap OAuth integration for team/player data import
- Baseball lineup generation with pitcher rotation (2 innings max per pitcher)
- Visual baseball diamond field graphics
- Print-friendly layouts for field use
- Position preferences (pitcher, catcher, any position)
- Smart position assignment algorithm with player history tracking
- SSL/HTTPS support for OAuth callbacks
- Sport configuration system (JSON-based, supports baseball, soccer, volleyball)

### In Development
- Soccer lineup generation with goalkeeper requirements (Issue #53 remaining)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.x required
# pip package manager
# TeamSnap API credentials (from TeamSnap Developer Portal)
```

### Required Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy .env.example to .env and add your TeamSnap API credentials
cp .env.example .env

# IMPORTANT: Add FLASK_SSL=true to .env file for HTTPS support
echo "FLASK_SSL=true" >> .env
```

### Startup Commands

**PREFERRED METHOD (handles SSL and environment automatically):**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**ALTERNATIVE MANUAL STARTUP:**
```bash
# For HTTPS (required for TeamSnap OAuth):
FLASK_SSL=true python3 app.py

# For HTTP only (development testing):
python3 app.py
```

**Access**: https://localhost:5000 (HTTPS required for TeamSnap OAuth)
**Note**: Accept security warning for self-signed certificate in browser

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start application with SSL
./start.sh

# Start application manually with HTTPS
FLASK_SSL=true python3 app.py

# Start application without SSL (limited functionality)
python3 app.py

# Install new dependencies
pip install <package-name>
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Pre-commit hooks (run automatically on commit)
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all checks manually
pre-commit run black        # Run specific check
pre-commit install          # Install git hooks (one-time setup)

# Database operations (if applicable)
python3 manage.py db migrate
python3 manage.py db upgrade
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

**3-Stage GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`):

1. **Quick Validation** (15-30s) - Code formatting, import sorting, linting
2. **Tests & SonarQube** (2-3min) - Unit tests, coverage, quality gate
3. **Claude Review** (3-5min) - AI-powered code review

**Key Features:**
- 6 layers of safeguards ensure test failures block pipeline
- SonarQube integration for code quality tracking
- isort configured with Black profile (`.isort.cfg`)
- See `docs/development/ci-cd-pipeline.md` for full documentation

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit and edge case tests
./lineup-venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/ tests/edge_cases/ -v

# Run with coverage
./lineup-venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/ tests/edge_cases/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
./lineup-venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_lineup_generation.py -v

# Run visual regression tests (requires app running)
./lineup-venv/bin/pytest tests/visual/ -v
```

**Test Coverage:** 94%+ (151/153 tests passing)
**Test Organization:** Unit, edge cases, visual regression
**Documentation:** `docs/testing/guidelines.md`

## API Integration

### TeamSnap API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 required
- **HTTPS Requirement**: Mandatory for redirect URIs
- **Rate Limiting**: Considerations for production deployment
- **Response Format**: Collection+JSON format for API responses
- **Environment Variables**: See `.env.example` for required credentials
  - `TEAMSNAP_CLIENT_ID`
  - `TEAMSNAP_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `TEAMSNAP_REDIRECT_URI`

### API Endpoints (Application)
- `/` - Home page
- `/auth/teamsnap` - TeamSnap OAuth initialization
- `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `/teams` - List imported teams
- `/generate-lineup` - Create lineup for selected team
- `/print-lineup` - Print-friendly lineup view

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment
```bash
# Login to Heroku
heroku login

# Create new app
heroku create multisport-lineup-app

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set TEAMSNAP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
heroku config:set TEAMSNAP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
heroku config:set TEAMSNAP_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.herokuapp.com/auth/callback

# Deploy
git push heroku main

# Open application
heroku open
```

### Production Considerations
- PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite
- Environment-based configuration
- SSL/TLS certificates from trusted CA
- TeamSnap API rate limiting handling
- Multi-user authentication system
- Payment integration (planned)

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **TeamSnap API**: OAuth 2.0 authentication, team/player data import
  - Requires client ID and secret from TeamSnap Developer Portal
  - HTTPS redirect URI mandatory
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis (production instance at 44.206.255.230:9000)

### Python Packages (requirements.txt)
- Flask, requests, pytest, pytest-cov
- See `requirements.txt` for complete list

### Development Tools
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Black, isort, Flake8 for local code quality checks
- **CI/CD Tools**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, bandit (GitHub Actions)
- **Playwright**: Visual regression tests
- **Pre-commit package**: Installed in virtual environment (`pip install pre-commit`)

## Known Issues

- **Virtual environment required**: Ubuntu 24.04+ requires venv for pip installs
- **Port conflicts**: Check port 5000 availability before starting app
- **Self-signed certificates**: Browser warnings expected in local development
- **TeamSnap API rate limiting**: Not yet implemented for production use

## Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Branch Workflow
- **NEVER commit directly to main branch**
- **ALWAYS create a feature branch first** - NO EXCEPTIONS
- Even for small fixes, typos, or documentation - use branches and PRs

**Process:**
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/description` or `fix/bug-name`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push branch: `git push -u origin branch-name`
4. Create PR: `gh pr create`
5. Wait for CI/CD checks to pass
6. **Ask user before merging** - Never merge without approval

**Branch naming:**
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/bug-name` - Bug fixes
- `docs/topic` - Documentation updates

See global `~/Code/CLAUDE.md` for complete Git workflow documentation.

## Important Notes

- **HTTPS Required**: TeamSnap OAuth requires HTTPS for redirect URIs
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Local development uses self-signed certificates (browser warnings expected)
- **TeamSnap API**: Requires approved application and API credentials from TeamSnap Developer Portal
- **Print Optimization**: Designs optimized for printing on field (landscape layouts, clear fonts)
- **PRD Workflow**: Use `ai_docs/create-prd.mdc` for creating new feature PRDs with GitHub issue tracking
